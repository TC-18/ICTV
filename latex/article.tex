  Interactive visualization is a very convenient tool to explore
  complex scientific data or to explore different parameter settings
  for a given processing algorithm. In this article, we present a tool
  to efficiently explore the curvature tensor on the boundary of
  potentially large digital objects. More precisely, we combine a
  fully parallel pipeline on GPU to extract an adaptive triangulated
  isosurface of the digital object, with a curvature tensor
  estimation at each surface point based on integral
  invariants. Integral invariants being parametrized by a given ball
  radius, our proposal allows us to explore interactively different
  radii and thus select the appropriate scale to which the computation
  is performed and visualized (mean and gaussian curvature, principal
  curvatures, principal directions and normal vector field).

\section{Isosurface Extraction on GPU}
\label{sec:isos-extr-gpu}

In this section, we detail the adaptive isosurface extraction
algorithm. The proposed approach is based on an octree representation
of the input object on which an efficient adaptive triangulation
of the isosurface is constructed on GPU. Such approach is motivated by
the fact that the hierarchical representation of the object allows us
to handle large datasets and to locally adapt the level of details
with respect to the geometry or camera position. We first present the
octree representation and then the isosurface extraction from
hierarchical octree cells.

\subsection{Linear Octree Representation}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

  \end{center}
\caption{Morton codes associated to cells of a linear quatree. Each
   morton code of a child cell is obtained by adding a suffix to its
  parent code \emph{(left)}. The adaptive representation consists of
  quadtree cells whose depth is view point dependent
  \emph{(middle)}. Finally, adaptive Marching-Cubes is used to
  generate the triangulation \emph{(right)}.}
\label{fig_quadtree_partitionning}
\end{figure}

Representing a hierachical structure on GPU is usually challenging
since the GPU memory is limited and non consistent \todo{fix coherent/aligned/coalesced?}
memory access (\emph{e.g.} tree traversal using pointer dereferencing)
may lead to huge payload from cache misses.  Efficient spatial tree
encoding can be achieved using pointerless strictures. We use here
linear quadtrees or octrees to represent classical quadtree/octreee
trees, see for instance Gargantini
\cite{gargantini1982effective}. This structure consists in indexing
each cell by a \emph{Morton code}: the code of children cells are
defined by the code of the parent suffixed by two bits (in dimension
2, three bits in dimension 3) (see Figure
\ref{fig_quadtree_partitionning}-\emph{left}). For a given cell, its
code encodes its position with respect to its parent cell and its
complete path to the tree root. Hence, whatever their depth, all cell
codes are simply stored in a linear vector on memory. Furthermore,
cell operations such as subdivision, merging, neighbors access can be
efficiently implemented using bitwise operations on the Morton code.
In the following, we use the GPU implementation proposed by Dupuy
\textit{et al.}  \cite{dupuy2014quadtrees}. In such approach, Morton
codes and bitwise operations are optimized to match with GPU hardware
requirements.

\subsection{Data parallel and adaptive mesh generation}



Using this spatial datastructure, triangulated mesh can be constructed
from a Marching-Cubes approach \cite{lorensen1987marching} (MC for short): the
triangulation is generated from local triangle patches computed on
local cell configurations. Since triangle patches are locally
computed, such approach is fully parallel and easy to implement on GPU
hardwares. However, since adjacent cells may not have the same depth
on the octree, original Lorensen and Cline's rules need to be
updated (see Figure~\ref{fig_quadtree_partitionning}-\emph{right}). Many authors have addressed this problem both for primal and
dual meshes
\cite{shu1995adaptive,schaefer2004dual,lengyel2010voxel,DBLP:journals/cgf/LewinerMPPL10,DBLP:journals/cvgip/LobelloDD14}.

In the following, we use the extension of MC configurations to handle
adaptive structures proposed by Lengyel \emph{et al.}
\cite{lengyel2010voxel}. First this approach constrains the octree
structure in order to make sure that the depth difference between any
two adjacent cells is at most one. Then, Lengyel \emph{et al.} propose
specific MC configurations for such transition cells,  leading to a
crack-free triangulation.

Similarly to original MC algorithm, this approach is perfectly adapted
to GPU hardwares: Given a set of cells (a vector of morton codes),
each triangle patch can be constructed in parallel (done by 
in the \emph{geometry shader} in the GPU graphic pipeline).

\subsection{Level of Details Criteria and Temporal Updates}


As illustrated in Figure
\ref{fig_quadtree_partitionning}-\emph{middle}, we propose a viewpoint
dependent criterion to decide if a cell needs to be refined: the
closer we are to the camera, the finer the cells are. In addition to
the distance criterion, we define an angular criterion to refine cells
within the camera frustrum. When rendering a mesh, a key stage is the
rasterization one which digitizes triangles projected onto the
screen. As a consequence, having several triangles whose projections
lie inside the same pixel is something we should prevent. Hence,
distance criterion can be set in order to both control the geometrical
approximation and to ensure that cells project onto more than one
pixel. Figure \ref{fig_lod_octree} illustrates the level of details
(LoD for short criterion) we use.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=0.2\textheight]{subdivision}
\caption{The octree at frame $t$ is stored as a list of Morton codes in a buffer. 
To update the tree, we fill a new buffer representing its state at frame $t+1$. 
On the GPU, each code of the first buffer is processed in parallel. 
If the cell is to be subdivided, it writes the codes of its children in the new buffer. 
If it merges, it writes either nothing, or the code of its parent (if it is the first child).
If it is kept, it just re-writes its own code. }

A {\em cell} is a tuple $(k,x,y,z)$, which represents a region of the space of size $2^k \times
2^k \times 2^k$, characterized by its integer coordinates $x,y,z$,
with $0 \le x < 2^k$, $0 \le y < 2^k$, $0 \le z < 2^k$. Cells forms an
octree decomposition of a cubic space. We use functions Up, Down and
Next to navigate between cells.
