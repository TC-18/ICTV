	make ICTV
	
Usage : ./ICTV <data_file> <type> <size> [light]


Type:	1 - .raw files
	2 - Enter a piece of glsl code filling a variable h with the implicit fonction to render.
	x, y, and z are available variables containing the position of the vertex in [-10:10].
	t is a variable containing the time elapsed is seconds.
	A point (x,y,z) is considered inside if h < 0.

Size:	default = 256

Light: 	If a fourth argument is given (whatever its value), the application runs in light mode. 
	It requires less GPU memory but does not allow to export the data
		
Examples:
./ICTV "h=y - sin(t)*sin(x)" 2 128
./ICTV ../../data/raw/bunny_border_67.raw 1 67


Dependencies: SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, openexr, glew


data contains two txt files, vp & qp.
Those are transformations matrices used to remember/load a viewpoint.
